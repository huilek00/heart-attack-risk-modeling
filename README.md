# Predictive Modeling of Heart Disease Risk Factors and Policy Impact Simulation

## Project Overview
This project explores **heart disease risk factors** using **data analytics** and **predictive modeling**. Written in **R language**, the analysis leverages **logistic regression** and **policy simulations** to evaluate the impact of potential health policies—such as **smoking cessation** and **increased physical activity**—on reducing heart attack risks. By quantifying potential reductions in heart attack probabilities, the project provides valuable data-driven insights for public health decision-making.

The documentation provides an in-depth overview of the methodology, including **data preprocessing**, **model development**, and **result visualization**, all implemented to assess the influence of various risk factors and policy interventions on heart attack risks.

## Key Features
- Developed a **weighted logistic regression model** to predict heart attack risk, addressing class imbalance
- Simulated the impact of three health interventions:
  - Universal **physical activity adoption**
  - **Complete smoking cessation**
  - A **combined approach** of both interventions
- Quantified potential reductions in heart attack probability across **age groups**
- **Data-driven policy recommendations** based on predictive modeling insights
